# Pigeonhole-Homework1
If there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then there must be at least one pigeonhole with at least two pigeons in it.
Theorem –
I) If “A” is the average number of pigeons per hole, where A is not an integer then
 1) At least one pigeon hole contains ceil[A] (smallest integer greater than or equal to A) pigeons
 2) Remaining pigeon holes contains at most floor[A] (largest integer less than or equal to A) pigeons
II) We can say as, if n + 1 objects are put into n boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects.
The abstract formulation of the principle: Let X and Y be finite sets and let f: X –> Y be a function.
 1) If X has more elements than Y, then f is not one-to-one.
 2) If X and Y have the same number of elements and f is onto, then f is one-to-one.
 3) If X and Y have the same number of elements and f is one-to-one, then f is onto.
Pigeonhole principle is one of the simplest but most useful ideas in mathematics. We will see more applications that proof of this theorem.

Example: Suppose there are "n" number of people in a room. Two or more people will have same birthday.
Solution: If number of people in room is greater than number of days in a year, then at-least two people will have
same birthday. e.g.
Number of people in room = n= 500
Number of days in an year = d = 365 (normal year) or 366 (leap year)
Number of people having same birthday = bd = n/d = 1.37
Hence according to Pigeonhole principle ceiling for current case will be 2 i.e. two people will have same birthday.
